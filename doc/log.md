# OOAD Lab 3: Flight Reservation System

I have tried twice on the project, and both failed. By the time I've already missed the deadline. I started too high,
yet my engineering skills were way too insufficient to support the goals. It's painful to admit it but, I have to start
really small, before I could handle a project that is of industrial-product quality.

It really feels bad to cast away a project with numerous analysis & design docs, and a code base of tens of KBs. But I'm
pretty sure that if I don't hone my engineering skills steadily, with very-small baby-steps, I don't get what I really
want ever.

Alas.
